A small tool to split html files generated from [**Tyrrrz**/DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter) into smaller files of 100 messages containers per page

## Usage
```bash
deplitter html_file_or_directory
```
And that's all.

The tool will create a folder with the same name as the given html-file(s) and put the smaller files in there. The original data will be left untouched.
